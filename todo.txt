- use haplorec as a git submodule and have it play nice with eclipse
- use a grails plugin (reverse engineer i think) to generate domains from existing haplorec db schema
- generate controllers
- make a draft plan for a web UI for a dependency graph of sql tables (i.e. the job_patient_* tables)
  - try to make an abstract grails module (plugin?) that generates this UI; if too hard, make it adhoc

- try using qunit for unit testing js code ( http://qunitjs.com/ )
  - http://qunitjs.com/intro/
    good examples of testing DOM manipulating code
  - http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/
    good examples of testing ajax code Asynchronous Callbacks
- use jsPlumb for flowcharts ( http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/jquery/flowchartConnectorsDemo.html )
- use dustjs for templating 
  - http://grails.org/plugin/dustjs-resources for compiling dust templates to js 
  - figure out how to configure (i.e. where to put what files)
- use backbonejs for MVC design style
  - http://grails.org/plugin/backbonejs
  - use todo list example for learning backbonejs
- example project using both backbonejs and dustjs ( https://github.com/coderguy/demandware )
  - there seems to be a common pattern for dust template rendering from backbone views; abstract this ( 
    https://github.com/coderguy/demandware/blob/master/app/javascript/backbone/views/HomeView.js )

- fix annoying build problems when trying to import haplorec project into haplorec-wui (kludge it by placing a symbolic link in src/groovy pointing to 
  projects/haplorec/src/)

[o] implement algo for finding level of dependencies in the dependency graph
[o] subclass Depenedency with HaplotypeDependency
[o] convert HaplotypeDependency to JSON (make unit tests)?
  - it mostly works by just importing grails.converters.JSON and doing HaplotypeInput.haplotypeDepedencyGraph() as JSON, we just need to fix a couple things:
    - don't include these fields: class, finished (where'd this come from), rule
    - only want to render dependencies by their target names, not by recursively calling JSON converter
[o] create a backbone model with 1-to-1 correspondence to HaplotypeDependency, and instantiate using JSON data
[o] deserialize the json-ified HaplotypeDependency and load them into backbone models
  - use request.JSON ( http://nematodes.org/martin/2009/12/18/using-jquery-to-send-json-data-to-a-grails-app/, http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#xmlAndJSON )
[o] create a HaplotypeDependencyGraph model (see notes)
- create a HaplotypeDependencyGraphView (see notes)
  - figure out how to use dustjs; if too hard, fallback to underscore
- figure out how backbone's notion of collections ties in with how to structure code
